# creating a SC driving system instance, connecting to it and sending your first sequence can be
# done when initializing your experiment. When appropriate, execute your sequence by implementing
# 'execute_sequence()' into your code.

# when you want to change your sequence in the middle of your experimental code, create a new
# sequence as above and send the new sequence: 'send_sequence()'. When appropriate, execute your
# sequence by implementing 'execute_sequence()' into your code.

# It is important to place your experimental code into a try-finally block, so if your code is
# stopped abruptly, the driving system will be disconnected. Otherwise, there is a change that it
# keeps on firing ultrasound sequences.
